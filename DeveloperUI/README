Please refer to the wiki for a getting started guide:
https://github.com/flashquartermaster/Cuke4AS3/wiki/How-To-Use-Cuke4AS3

The DeveloperUI provides an easy way to get started with Cuke4AS3 and creates a visual environment to
view your application as it runs from your step definitions. It integrates simple savable configuration
and a view of the compiler and cucumber output for fast feedback when working with Cuke4AS3 on a day to
day basis in a development environment.

It contains helpful debugging info care of DConsole which is accessible by pressing ctrl + shift + Return.

It also serves as a template for developing your own user interfaces that might do a lot more with the
outputs from your step definitions e.g. Displaying some telemetry about your applications behavior.
