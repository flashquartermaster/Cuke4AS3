If your just getting started with this and are a bit unsure try the DeveloperUI and its getting started
guide first.

Cuke4AS3 is a chromeless command line application and library swc.

Chromeless Application
======================
As a chromeless app it can be run silently when installed from the commandline with the relevant args
e.g.
/Applications/Cuke4AS3-n.n.n-Alpha.app/Contents/MacOS/Cuke4AS3-n.n.n-Alpha [ARGS]

-srcDir path to the parent directory of your features directory (in double quotes)
E.g. -srcDir "/Users/username/Documents/Adobe Flash Builder 4.5/Calculator/src/"

srcDir must contain a 'features' directory which can in turn contain a [filename].wire file
and 'step_definitions' directory for *.as step definitions

-mxmlc path to mxmlc executable
E.g. -mxmlc "/Applications/Adobe Flash Builder 4.5/sdks/4.5.1/bin/mxmlc"

-mxmlcArgs Additional compiler args for your project e.g. project libs directory or air libs
E.g. -mxmlcArgs "'-compiler-arg arg 'path with spaces' -other-compiler-arg arg'"

-cucumber
OSX: path to cucumber executable
Windows: path to ruby.exe

-cucumberArgs Additional cucumber args
(Windows: start with the path to cucumber)
E.g. -cucumberArgs "'--cucumber-arg arg --other-arg arg'"
(remember to output the cucumber results from -cucumberArgs e.g. "'-f html -o some/path/to.html'"
or you wont get any results to view)

NOTE: For mxmlc and cucumber args THE WHOLE STRING MUST BE ENCLOSED BY SINGLE QUOTES WITHOUT WHITE SPACE
File paths with spaces in MUST BE ENCLOSED IN SINGLE QUOTES

-headless true A switch to tell the app that it is chromeless and that it should exit when it finishes its run

ADL
===
It can also be run verbosely using adl e.g
adl -profile extendedDesktop Cuke4AS3-app.xml -- -srcDir "path/to/features/parent/dir"
-mxmlc "path/to/mxmlc" -mxmlcArgs "'-compiler.library-path 'path/to/frameworks/libs/air/' 'path/to/project/libs''"
-cucumber "/usr/bin/cucumber" -cucumberArgs "'-f html -o path/to/report.html'" -headless true

ANT & CI
========
For an example of how to run it with ant and adl as part of CI see the cuke4as3-build.xml target "cucumber-self-test"

SWC
===
As a swc it can be used as a basis for an application with a UI e.g. The DeveloperUI module

Added: Check all cucumber arguments for errant behavior on all production platforms and document known issues
Added: Set up Cuke4AS3 on relish
Updated: Remove "file://" in swfToLoad on BinarySwfLoader
Updated: Improve special characters replace regexp for formatting gerkin steps to actionscript function names for snippets
Updated: Create build.properties cucumber location property and *nix native package file extension (dmg and deb) property
